# E-Commerce-Backend

## Description

This project is a backend-database for an e-commerce platform! I wanted to create this project to get more experience with sequelize! This project can be modified for any online shops and it provides a backend that saves data about the products. It also allows you to modify and delete products!

## Installation

This project requires insomnia to view the data.

## Usage

As this is a backend application, in order to use the routes and access the data you must use insomnia. On your localhost in your terminal, first enter into mysql and then source the database. Then exit out of mysql.

Next, seed the data by running 'node seeds/index.js'. Then, run "npm start' to start the server. Now you can enter 'localhost:3001/api/" to run the routes and interact with the data on insomnia!

There are three folders in my insomnia, which demonstrate the different route methods for each folder of data, Categories, Tags, and Products.

To view these routes being used, watch the walkthrough video.

## Credits

I used async/await in this homework, which I learned mostly through the second class project. You can view the code for that project [here](https://github.com/Achurale/DnD-Character-Maker)
